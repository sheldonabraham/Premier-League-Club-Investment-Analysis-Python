### Key learning after this project:
* Data cleaning refers to the process of detecting and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset to ensure that it is accurate and reliable.

* Observation writing involves examining the data and taking note of any significant findings, anomalies, or areas of interest that may arise during the analysis.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and visualizing a dataset to understand its main characteristics, such as the distribution of data, the relationships between variables, and any patterns or anomalies that may exist. The primary objective of EDA is to uncover insights and trends that can inform further analysis or decision-making. It is typically the first step in any data analysis project, as it provides a foundation for more advanced statistical methods and models.

* When dealing with null values in a dataset, domain-specific imputation can be used to fill in missing values based on knowledge of the domain or subject matter. This approach can help ensure that the imputed values are accurate and consistent with the underlying data.
